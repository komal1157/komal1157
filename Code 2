Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:
# a) To display word with the longest length
# b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
# c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not
# d) To display index of first appearance of the substring
# e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string.


# a) To display word with the longest length

sentence = input("Enter string: ")

longest = max(sentence.split(), key=len)

print("Longest word is: ", longest)
print("And its length is: ", len(longest))


# b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string

# using naive method to get count of each element in string
all_freq = {}
